A series of Playgrounds to learn how Combine works.

Combine is the native reactive programming API for Swift developed by Apple. It aims to replace the various asynchronous programming mechanisms existing in the different plataforms (`NotificationCenter`, closures, delegates, etc.), as an alternative to other third-party frameworks such as RxSwift.

This work is based on the "Combine: Asynchronous Programming with Swift book", by the raywenderlich.com Tutorial Team.
