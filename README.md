A series of playgrounds to learn how Combine works.

Combine is the **native reactive programming API** for Swift developed by Apple. It aims to replace the various asynchronous programming mechanisms existing in the different Apple's plataforms (`NotificationCenter`, closures, delegates, etc.), as an alternative to other third-party frameworks such as RxSwift.

This work is based on the book:

[Combine: Asynchronous Programming with Swift book](https://www.raywenderlich.com/11285622-combine-asynchronous-programming-with-swift) by the raywenderlich.com Tutorial Team.
